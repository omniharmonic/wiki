# Ingest Meetings

Process all markdown files in `_inbox/meetings/` with `status: pending_enrichment`.

## Overview

This command transforms raw meeting transcripts into rich, interconnected knowledge base entries by:
1. Extracting and creating entity files (people, concepts, organizations)
2. Generating summaries if missing
3. Adding wiki-links throughout the content
4. Routing to the appropriate project folder

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find Pending Files

```bash
ls _inbox/meetings/*.md
```

Check each file's frontmatter for `status: pending_enrichment`.
If `$ARGUMENTS` provided, process only that specific file.

### Step 2: Load Project Context

Read all `projects/*/PROJECT.md` files to build matching context:
- Project names and aliases
- Team member names and emails
- Keywords for matching

### Step 3: For Each Pending Meeting

---

## Entity Extraction (CRITICAL)

Analyze the transcript and identify ALL entities:

### People
- Names mentioned in speech
- Email addresses referenced
- Speakers in the conversation
- Anyone assigned action items

### Organizations
- Companies mentioned
- Institutions referenced
- Partner organizations

### Concepts
- Technical terms discussed
- Methodologies mentioned
- Frameworks referenced
- Domain-specific terminology

### Tools/Platforms
- Software tools discussed
- Platforms mentioned
- Services referenced

**Output a list of all extracted entities with their type.**

---

## Entity File Creation

### For Each Person

Check if `people/{Name}.md` exists. If not, create:

```markdown
---
name: "{Full Name}"
type: person
email: "{if known}"
organization: "{if mentioned}"
role: "{if mentioned}"
first_seen: {meeting date}
tags:
  - person
---

# {Full Name}

First encountered in: [[{path to this meeting}]]

## Context

{Brief note about how they were mentioned}

## Meetings

<!-- Dataview query will show related meetings -->

## Notes

<!-- Add more context as you learn about this person -->
```

### For Each Concept

Check if `concepts/{Concept}.md` exists. If not, create:

```markdown
---
name: "{Concept Name}"
type: concept
aliases:
  - "{any alternative names}"
first_seen: {meeting date}
tags:
  - concept
---

# {Concept Name}

First encountered in: [[{path to this meeting}]]

## Definition

{Brief definition based on meeting context, or leave as TODO}

## Related

- [[other related concepts if known]]

## Mentions

<!-- Meetings where this concept appears -->
```

### For Each Organization

Check if `organizations/{Org}.md` exists (create folder if needed). If not, create:

```markdown
---
name: "{Organization Name}"
type: organization
website: "{if mentioned}"
first_seen: {meeting date}
tags:
  - organization
---

# {Organization Name}

First encountered in: [[{path to this meeting}]]

## About

{Brief description based on context}

## People

- [[people who work here if mentioned]]

## Mentions

<!-- Meetings where this org appears -->
```

---

## Meeting File Enrichment

Transform the meeting file to have this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "{Cleaned descriptive title}"
date: {ISO timestamp}
duration: {minutes if known}
status: processed
source: meetily
project: "[[projects/{matched}/index]]"
participants:
  - "[[people/Person One]]"
  - "[[people/Person Two]]"
themes:
  - {theme-1}
  - {theme-2}
tags:
  - meeting
  - {project-slug}
processed_at: {current ISO timestamp}
confidence: {high|medium|low}
---

# {Meeting Title}

> **Project:** [[projects/{project}/index]]
> **Date:** {formatted date}
> **Participants:** [[people/Person One]], [[people/Person Two]]

## Summary

{2-3 paragraph summary of the meeting. If Meetily provided a summary, use that. Otherwise, generate from transcript.}

## Key Insights

- {Most important insight or decision}
- {Second key insight}
- {Third key insight}

## Action Items

- [ ] {Action item 1} - @[[people/Assignee]] (due: {date if mentioned})
- [ ] {Action item 2} - @[[people/Assignee]]
- [ ] {Action item 3}

## Decisions Made

- {Decision 1 and its context}
- {Decision 2}

## Topics Discussed

### {Topic 1}

{Brief summary of discussion around this topic, with [[wiki-links]] to relevant concepts}

### {Topic 2}

{Brief summary}

## Next Steps

- {Next step 1}
- {Next step 2}

---

## Full Transcript

{Original transcript with wiki-links added for first occurrences of:
- People → [[people/Name]]
- Projects → [[projects/slug/index]]  
- Concepts → [[concepts/Term]]
- Organizations → [[organizations/Name]]
}
```

---

## Wiki-Linking Rules

### What to Link
- **People:** First mention of each person → `[[people/Full Name]]`
- **Projects:** Project names/aliases → `[[projects/slug/index|Display Name]]`
- **Concepts:** Technical terms, methodologies → `[[concepts/Term]]`
- **Organizations:** Companies, institutions → `[[organizations/Name]]`

### Linking Guidelines
- Link first occurrence only (don't over-link)
- Maximum 15-20 links per document
- Don't link common words or obvious terms
- Preserve original text in display: `[[people/Benjamin Life|Benjamin]]`
- Skip linking inside code blocks or quotes

---

## Project Matching

Score each project based on content:

| Signal | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Project name in content | +5 |
| Project alias mentioned | +4 |
| Team member name found | +3 |
| Project keyword found | +2 |

**Thresholds:**
- ≥8 points: Strong match → `projects/[name]/meetings/`
- 4-7 points: Moderate match → same, add confidence note
- <4 points: No match → `meetings/YYYY-MM-DD/`

---

## File Placement

After enrichment, move the file:

**If project matched:**
```
projects/{project-slug}/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD_{descriptive-slug}.md
```

**If no match:**
```
meetings/YYYY-MM-DD/{descriptive-slug}.md
```
