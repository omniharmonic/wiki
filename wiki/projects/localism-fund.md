# Localism Fund

Deploying grant funding through subsidiarity-based allocation mechanisms — directing resources to place-based work using participatory decision-making.

## Approach

Quadratic funding and other mechanism designs that operationalize genuine pluralism in resource allocation. The cost of additional influence increases quadratically, making it expensive to dominate but accessible to express genuine preference.
