# The Beauty Way Declaration

## Principles for a Beautiful, Purposeful, and Honest Life

I strive in all that I do and with all that I AM to create beauty and celebrate life.

I strive to feel fully all the joy, pain, pleasure, sorrow, love, and the myriad expressions of human emotion & experience, that I may be a hollow bone through which the pure light of source consciousness can play, dance, and experience itself.

I strive to integrate, within myself and within the world, all sources of disharmony, disease, and deceit within widening circles of unconditional love.

I strive to know who I AM and what I incarnated on Earth to do.

I strive to be in integrity with the spark of light that I AM.

I strive to walk in balance with all Beings and with Creation herself.

I strive to steward all that is within my care to be healthy, whole, and thriving.

## I AM THAT I AM

## LIGHT OF THE ONE

## SURRENDERED TO THE VOID

## FROM WHICH IT CAME
