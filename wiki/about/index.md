# Benjamin Life

> *"Not the imposed harmony of a conductor forcing consensus, but the emergent harmony of a jazz ensemble — where each player's improvisations create something none could achieve alone."*

## Who I Am

Civic innovator, systems thinker, and bioregional organizer based in Boulder, Colorado. I work at the intersection of participatory governance, regenerative economics, and community coordination — building infrastructure for a world that works for all.

## What I Do

- **[[wiki/projects/opencivics|OpenCivics]]** — Co-Founder. A consortium for civic innovation and participatory democracy systems.
- **[[wiki/projects/localism-fund|Localism Fund]]** — Co-Steward. Participatory grant funding for place-based work.
- **[[wiki/projects/regen-commons|Regen Commons]]** — Co-Founder. Regenerative commons coordination.
- **Spirit of the Front Range** — Bioregional organizer for Colorado's Front Range.

## The Animating Question

Since age twelve, I've asked the same question:

> *"Why is the world so full of suffering and why haven't we collectively chosen to create a more beautiful one?"*

This question drives everything — through documentary filmmaking, virtual reality, international development, and now civic innovation. The answer I've arrived at: **systems, not souls.** Transformation happens by changing incentive structures and coordination mechanisms, not by changing individual minds.

## Core Frameworks

- [[wiki/concepts/bioregionalism|Bioregionalism]] — Ecological boundaries as natural units of governance
- [[wiki/concepts/cosmolocalism|Cosmolocalism]] — What is heavy is local; what is light is global
- [[wiki/concepts/polycentric-governance|Polycentric Governance]] — Nested decision-making at the scale of impact
- [[wiki/concepts/commons-governance|Commons Governance]] — Shared stewardship without capture
