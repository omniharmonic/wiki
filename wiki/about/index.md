> *"It's not the note you play that's the wrong note. It's the note you play afterwards that makes it right or wrong."* — Miles Davis

omniharmonic examines how fragmented modern systems might achieve polyphonic coherence — not the imposed harmony of a conductor forcing consensus, but the emergent harmony of a jazz ensemble where each player's improvisations create something none could achieve alone.

### Post-Tragic Approach

The essays here acknowledge institutional breakdown and cascading crises while exploring how collapse creates space for alternative organizing logics. This includes [[concepts/bioregionalism|bioregional]] networks, [[concepts/quadratic-funding|quadratic funding]] mechanisms, [[concepts/commons-governance|commons governance]], and [[concepts/cosmolocalism|cosmolocal]] production patterns.

### Systems Integration

This work traces how forests coordinate nutrient distribution, information sharing, and defense through mycelial networks — demonstrating how economy, communication, and governance can operate as unified systems rather than separate domains.

### Deep Listening

omniharmonic emphasizes reinhabitation — perceiving the living systems we're embedded within and treating watersheds, soil communities, and seasonal rhythms as relationships to tend rather than resources to extract.
