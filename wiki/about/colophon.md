# Colophon

This wiki is a living knowledge base — a public-facing subset of a larger personal knowledge management system.

## How It's Built

- **Content**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Processing**: [OPAL](https://github.com/omniharmonic) — AI-powered knowledge extraction and organization
- **Publishing**: [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) — static site generator with knowledge graph visualization
- **Search**: Full-text search with semantic capabilities
- **Graph**: Interactive relationship visualization connecting concepts, projects, and research

## Philosophy

Knowledge should be a commons — shared freely, attributed properly, and stewarded collectively. This wiki publishes concepts, research, and writing that may be useful to others working on civic innovation, bioregional organizing, and regenerative systems.

Private project details, meeting notes, and personal content live in a separate, non-public vault.
