# Polycentric Governance

## Definition

Nested decision-making structures where choices happen at the scale of their impact. Neither centralized control nor anarchic fragmentation, but overlapping centers of authority each governing at their appropriate scope.

## Significance

Most governance failures stem from scale mismatch — decisions made too far from their consequences (centralization) or too fragmented to coordinate (atomization). Polycentric governance places decision-making authority at the level where the information exists and the consequences are felt.

## Core Principles

- **Subsidiarity** — Decisions at the lowest effective level
- **Overlap** — Multiple governance centers with distinct but intersecting domains
- **Emergence** — Higher-order coordination emerges from local interactions
- **Accountability** — Decision-makers face consequences of their choices
