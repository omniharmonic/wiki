# Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Founded by Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015, Ethereum extended Bitcoin's innovation of decentralized money into a general-purpose computational substrate capable of encoding complex economic relationships, governance structures, and coordination mechanisms. Unlike conventional platforms owned by corporations optimizing for extraction, Ethereum operates as a credibly neutral protocol that does not privilege particular actors, providing the technical foundation for infrastructure that serves users rather than harvests them.

Within the context of civilizational transformation, Ethereum is significant not merely as a technology but as the substrate upon which regenerative economic systems can be built. Its programmability allows values to be encoded directly into the infrastructure of exchange: tokens can be designed to circulate within bioregions, revenue can automatically flow to ecological restoration, and governance rights can be distributed according to contribution rather than capital. Vitalik Buterin's response to Marc Andreessen's techno-optimism, articulated as [[concepts/d-acc|defensive accelerationism]] (d/acc), positioned Ethereum's ecosystem as a counterforce to techno-authoritarian consolidation, arguing that defensive, democratic, and decentralized technologies can shift the game-theoretic landscape toward freedom rather than control.

Ethereum's ecosystem has become a proving ground for mechanisms central to the regenerative project. [[quadratic-funding|Quadratic funding]], developed by Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, and Glen Weyl, has been deployed through Gitcoin to allocate over seventy million dollars based on community preference signals. [[zero-knowledge-proofs|Zero-knowledge proofs]] developed on Ethereum Layer 2 solutions provide the cryptographic foundation for privacy-preserving identity that can resist surveillance infrastructure. [[ethereum-localism|Ethereum Localism]] communities are building tokenized community currencies and bioregional financing facilities. In this sense, Ethereum represents not crypto speculation but programmable economics designed for re-embedding value in relational substrates rather than extracting it into abstraction.
