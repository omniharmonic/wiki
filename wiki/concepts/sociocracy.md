# Sociocracy

Sociocracy is a system of governance and organizational design rooted in the principle of consent rather than consensus. Where consensus requires that every participant agree with a decision before it can move forward, sociocratic practice asks a different question: "Can you live with this decision? Do you see any paramount objections -- reasons this would cause harm or fundamentally undermine our shared purpose?" This distinction is not merely procedural but philosophical. Consent acknowledges that in complex systems, we cannot know in advance what the optimal decision is. We can only determine what seems workable given current understanding, and commit to learning together as we implement. Sociocracy typically organizes through nested circles of semi-autonomous teams, each with a defined domain of authority, connected through double-linking so that information and influence flow both upward and downward through the structure.

In Benjamin Life's essay "Leaderful Spaces," sociocratic practice is invoked as a foundation for what the essay calls "alignment beyond agreement." The essay distinguishes between the paralysis that often accompanies consensus-based decision-making -- where groups can never quite reach full agreement, or people agree outwardly while harboring private reservations -- and the dynamic forward movement that consent enables. Under consent, a participant can align their efforts with a path forward that would not have been their first choice, bringing their full capacity to the work while holding uncertainty about whether it is optimal. Strong dissent becomes a clear signal -- "I see a paramount objection that would cause real harm" -- while reservations, alternative preferences, and uncertainties can be held without blocking the group's movement. This creates space for genuine disagreement alongside practical action.

Sociocracy connects to [[commons-governance]] as one of the concrete decision-making frameworks through which commons can be democratically managed. It relates to [[participatory-democracy]] as a practice that distributes authority rather than concentrating it, and to [[collective-intelligence]] as a structure designed to surface the distributed wisdom of a group rather than defaulting to the loudest voice or highest-ranking position. It resonates with [[polycentric-governance]] through its nested circle structure, in which different domains of authority operate semi-autonomously while remaining connected to the whole. As a practice, sociocracy offers a concrete answer to the question of how leaderful spaces can make decisions without either hierarchical command or endless process.
