# Vibe Coding

Vibe coding refers to AI-assisted software development that makes the creation of digital tools accessible to non-programmers. By using natural language interfaces to generate, modify, and deploy code, vibe coding collapses the barrier between "people who can articulate what a community needs" and "people who can build the digital tools to address those needs." The person with the vision and the person with the technical capacity become the same person.

The significance for civic innovation is profound. The current digital landscape is dominated by platforms built by Silicon Valley engineers optimizing for engagement metrics and investor returns. Communities that need civic tools -- local governance platforms, mutual aid coordination systems, bioregional mapping tools -- must either depend on these extractive platforms or compete for scarce developer talent. Vibe coding disrupts this bottleneck, enabling community organizers, cooperative developers, and bioregional coordinators to build the tools they need themselves, iterating rapidly based on lived experience rather than distant market analysis.

Vibe coding connects to [[technological-sovereignty]] as a democratization of the capacity to build and maintain digital infrastructure. It relates to [[ethereum-localism]] through the possibility of non-technical communities deploying governance tools on decentralized infrastructure. And it contributes to [[collective-intelligence]] by expanding who can participate in designing the technical systems through which communities coordinate. The risk -- that AI-generated code produces fragile or insecure systems -- must be managed through shared civic code libraries, peer review processes, and federated knowledge commons for civic technology patterns.
