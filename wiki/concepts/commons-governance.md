# Commons Governance

## Definition

Patterns for managing shared resources that prevent capture while enabling coordination. The commons is neither private property nor state-managed — it is collectively stewarded by those who depend on and contribute to it.

## Significance

The dominant narrative (Hardin's "Tragedy of the Commons") assumed that shared resources inevitably degrade without private ownership or state control. Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize-winning work demonstrated this is false — communities worldwide have successfully governed commons for centuries using diverse institutional arrangements.

Extending commons governance to digital resources (knowledge, software, protocols) is the foundation of cosmo-local coordination.

## Core Principles

- **Defined boundaries** — Clear about who the community of stewards is
- **Proportional costs/benefits** — Those who contribute more have appropriate voice
- **Collective choice** — Affected parties participate in rule-making
- **Monitoring** — Transparent tracking of resource use
- **Graduated sanctions** — Proportional responses to violations
- **Conflict resolution** — Accessible, low-cost mechanisms
- **Self-determination** — External authorities recognize community governance
- **Nested enterprises** — Commons within commons for complex resources
