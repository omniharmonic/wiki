# Bioregionalism

## Definition

A socio-cultural process of remembering belonging to place and ecology. Bioregionalism proposes that watersheds, soil communities, and ecological boundaries are the natural units of governance rather than arbitrary political boundaries.

## Significance

Modern governance operates on political boundaries drawn by colonial history, not ecological reality. Bioregionalism regrounds human organization in the living systems that actually sustain communities — recognizing that a watershed doesn't care about county lines.

This is not nostalgia for pre-industrial life. It's a recognition that effective coordination requires alignment between governance scale and ecological scale.

## Core Principles

- **Ecological boundaries over political ones** — Watersheds, not counties
- **Place-based identity** — "Person of place" as civic identity
- **Nested sovereignty** — Local self-governance within larger ecological contexts
- **Indigenous knowledge integration** — Honoring first peoples' relationship to land
