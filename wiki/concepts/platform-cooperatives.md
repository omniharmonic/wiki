# Platform Cooperatives

Platform cooperatives are digital platforms -- marketplaces, social networks, delivery services, creative tools -- that are owned and governed by the people who use and depend on them, rather than by venture capital investors seeking maximum extraction. They apply the democratic principles of [[worker-cooperatives]] to the digital economy, ensuring that the value generated by a platform's users flows back to those users rather than being siphoned into the portfolios of distant shareholders. Where conventional platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and DoorDash treat workers and communities as raw material for profit extraction, platform cooperatives treat them as sovereign stakeholders with genuine decision-making power.

The significance of platform cooperatives lies in their direct challenge to the logic of digital enclosure. The dominant tech platforms of our era function as what Benjamin Life calls the "egregore of capital" applied to the digital realm -- deterritorializing relationships, attention, and labor into abstract units of exchangeable value. Platform cooperatives reverse this dynamic by re-embedding digital economic activity within democratic governance and community accountability. A cooperatively owned ride-sharing platform, for instance, keeps surplus value circulating among drivers and riders rather than extracting it to Silicon Valley. A cooperatively governed social network can prioritize meaningful connection over addictive engagement metrics.

As the digital-age evolution of cooperative ownership, platform cooperatives connect the tradition of [[worker-cooperatives]] to the frontier of [[technological-sovereignty]] -- the capacity for communities to shape their own technological environments. They represent a key mechanism within [[economic-democracy]] for democratizing the digital economy, and they embody [[commons-governance]] principles applied to digital infrastructure. In the framework of regenerative accelerationism, platform cooperatives are one of the primary vehicles for "forking the source code" of extractive digital systems into community-serving alternatives.
