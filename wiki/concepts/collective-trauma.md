# Collective Trauma

Collective trauma is the accumulated psycho-spiritual and somatic wounding carried by groups, communities, and entire civilizations as a result of systemic violence, oppression, and disconnection perpetuated across generations. It is not merely the sum of individual traumas but a cultural pattern -- embedded in nervous systems, institutional structures, relational habits, and unconscious assumptions -- that reproduces itself through the very systems designed to manage it. Collective trauma operates at the level of ontological code: it shapes not just what people feel but the reality they participate in creating through their thoughts, words, and deeds.

The concept is central to understanding why the [[meta-crisis]] cannot be resolved through policy, technology, or ideology alone. If all systems of oppression and violence are rooted in and perpetuated by collective trauma, then a truly holistic response must have collective healing at its center. The thousands of years of inherited wounding -- from colonial genocide and slavery to the everyday violence of [[dominator-culture]] -- live not only in historical memory but in the bodies and relational patterns of living people. This trauma expresses itself as the constricted nervous systems that cling to narratives of scarcity, separation, and control; as the aversion to vulnerability that prevents genuine solidarity; and as the cycles of vengeance between victims and perpetrators that reproduce the very dynamics they seek to escape. The spells of the old story do not die instantly -- they haunt us around every corner, embedded in every interaction, reflected in the corners of our perception.

Collective trauma connects to [[dominator-culture]] as both its cause and consequence -- domination generates trauma, and unhealed trauma perpetuates domination. It relates to [[wetiko]] as the psychological substrate that makes the cannibal spirit's pattern of insatiable consumption possible: disconnection from felt reality allows extraction to continue without recognition of its cost. It connects to [[decolonization]] through the understanding that colonial violence created intergenerational wounds that must be named, witnessed, and integrated rather than bypassed. And it points toward practices of collective healing -- truth and reconciliation processes, community forums, trauma-informed ceremony, and the recovery of ancestral wisdom -- as essential components of any genuine movement toward a [[story-of-separation|post-separation]] civilization. As articulated through the image of collective trauma condensed into a diamond inside every human heart, the pressure of accumulated pain can itself become the catalyst for transformation when met with love, honesty, and the courage to strip naked before the mystery of what we truly are.
