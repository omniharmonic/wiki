# Buen Vivir

Buen Vivir ("good living") is a political philosophy and cosmological framework rooted in the indigenous Quechua concept of *sumak kawsay* -- a way of life that is community-centric, ecologically balanced, and culturally grounded. Unlike Western development paradigms that measure progress through GDP growth and individual consumption, Buen Vivir defines prosperity as the quality of relationship between self, community, and the natural world. It is not a program for economic development but a fundamentally different ontology of what it means to live well, one that emerges from millennia of indigenous governance and ecological stewardship in the Andes and Amazon.

Buen Vivir gained constitutional force when Ecuador and Bolivia enshrined it in their national constitutions, alongside the [[rights-of-nature]], representing what may be the most significant formal challenge to the Western development paradigm in modern history. Ecuador's FLOK Society project attempted to operationalize Buen Vivir through a peer-to-peer knowledge economy, envisioning networks of off-grid communities with solar power, micro-manufacturing, and cooperative enterprises sharing knowledge and resources through open protocols. While implementation has been fraught with contradictions -- Ecuador continued Amazon oil extraction even as its constitution proclaimed the rights of nature -- the conceptual contribution remains profound. As researcher Eduardo Gudynas articulates, "with buen vivir, the subject of wellbeing is not the individual, but the individual in the social context of their community and in a unique environmental situation." This fundamentally relational understanding of prosperity challenges the atomized, extractive logic of capitalist economics at its ontological root.

Buen Vivir connects to the [[well-being-economy]] as an indigenous philosophical ancestor of the broader movement to center human and ecological flourishing over GDP growth. It relates to [[decolonization]] as a living example of what post-colonial economics can look like when rooted in indigenous worldviews rather than Western reformism. It shares deep resonance with [[interbeing]] through its insistence that human well-being cannot be separated from the well-being of the land. And it challenges [[degrowth]] to go beyond quantitative reduction toward a qualitative reimagining of what prosperity means -- not less of the same, but something fundamentally different.
