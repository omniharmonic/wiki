# Regenerative Accelerationism

Regenerative accelerationism (re/acc) is a framework for accelerating the transition to post-capitalist, regenerative civilization by redirecting capitalism's self-amplifying feedback loops toward life-affirming ends rather than trying to reform or resist them. It accepts the accelerationist premise that technological and economic acceleration cannot be stopped, but rejects both the techno-capitalist endgame (merger with AI, posthuman singularity) and the reformist fantasy that capitalism can be made humane. Instead, re/acc proposes opting out of extractive systems while simultaneously re-embedding the tools of capital -- currency and computation -- to rebuild community-serving systems that compost energy and resources back into living relationships.

What distinguishes regenerative accelerationism from regeneration alone is its attention to system dynamics. Regeneration describes the what -- restoring ecosystems, rebuilding local economies, healing the relationship between humans and the living world. Re/acc describes the how: structuring regenerative work so that it creates self-amplifying feedback loops resistant to capture by capital. The formula is precise: through network effects produced by sovereign regenerative technologies, each person who opts out of technocapitalism makes it easier for others to do the same. If a food cooperative provides templates, capital, and supply chains that make the next cooperative easier to form, that is a regenerative feedback loop that compounds over time. This is the "aikido" of re/acc: taking the massive energy of the accelerating wave and redirecting it into loops that sink value back into relational substrates.

Re/acc builds on Vitalik Buterin's [[concepts/d-acc|d/acc]] (defensive accelerationism) as a complement and completion -- d/acc protects the space, re/acc fills it with regenerative alternatives. It draws on [[cosmolocalism]] for its pattern of global knowledge sharing and local implementation, on [[bioregionalism]] for its place-based organizing logic, on [[dual-power]] for its strategic framework of building alternatives alongside collapsing systems, and on [[ethereum-localism]] and [[regenerative-economics]] for its practical financial architecture. The manifesto is offered freely to the commons, embodying in its distribution the open-protocol ethos at the heart of its vision.
