# Localism

Localism is the political, economic, and cultural orientation toward rooting governance, production, and social life in place-based communities rather than in centralized, abstracted global systems. As economic localization, it describes the process of shifting productive capacity, resource flows, and decision-making authority back toward the local scale, rebuilding communities' capacity to meet their own needs rather than remaining dependent on extractive global supply chains controlled by distant actors. Localism is not isolationism; it is the recognition that certain challenges and opportunities are intrinsically tied to place, and that human flourishing depends on embeddedness in real relationships with specific lands, waters, and communities of life.

The significance of localism has intensified as AI and digital technologies simultaneously threaten global homogenization and enable unprecedented local capacity. Paradoxically, the same AI that accelerates capitalism's extractive logic also drives marginal production costs toward zero, creating conditions for what might be called "economies of scope": the efficient production of highly customized solutions for specific communities and contexts. The "vibe coding" revolution, in which AI assistants translate human intentions into working software, means communities can now build bespoke systems reflecting their own social arrangements and priorities. Server racks in community centers, local food cooperatives building their own supply chain management, neighborhoods creating governance tools with rules reflecting local values: these become practical possibilities rather than utopian fantasies. This represents a shift from centuries of centralization driven by economies of scale toward a new era where [[technological-sovereignty|technological sovereignty]] becomes achievable at the community level.

Localism connects to [[bioregionalism|bioregionalism]] through its attention to ecological boundaries as the natural units of human organization, and to [[cosmolocalism|cosmolocalism]] through the pattern of knowledge flowing globally while implementation stays local. It is the economic counterpart to Murray Bookchin's "libertarian municipalism," envisioning democratic, ecological, human-scale alternatives to both capitalism and state socialism. When localism is practiced through [[community-land-trusts|community land trusts]], [[worker-cooperatives|worker cooperatives]], mutual aid networks, and local currencies, it creates the material conditions for communities to withdraw from extractive systems while building regenerative alternatives that can function through disruption and institutional failure.
