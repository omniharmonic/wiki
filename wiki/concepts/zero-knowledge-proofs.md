# Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove the truth of a statement to another party without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. For example, you could prove you are over 18 without revealing your birthdate, prove you have sufficient funds without revealing your balance, or prove you are a member of a community without revealing your identity.

In the context of civic innovation, ZKPs represent a critical technology for resolving the tension between transparency and privacy in digital governance. Surveillance capitalism and the emerging AI surveillance state depend on the assumption that verification requires identification -- that to prove who you are, you must expose who you are. Zero-knowledge proofs break this assumption, enabling accountable governance without panopticon-like visibility into individuals' lives. This is essential for any democratic digital infrastructure that takes both accountability and civil liberties seriously.

ZKPs are foundational to [[self-sovereign-identity]] systems, where individuals control their own credentials and can selectively disclose attributes without exposing underlying data. They connect to [[ethereum-localism]] through their integration into blockchain-based governance tools, and to [[technological-sovereignty]] as a key technology for communities that want to participate in digital coordination without submitting to surveillance infrastructure. As AI-driven surveillance becomes more pervasive, zero-knowledge proofs may represent one of the most important technical safeguards for democratic society.
