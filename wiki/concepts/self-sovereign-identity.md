# Self-Sovereign Identity

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is an approach to digital identity in which individuals own and control their identity data without dependence on any centralized authority. Rather than platforms, governments, or corporations serving as the gatekeepers of identity -- deciding who you are and what you can access -- SSI places control with the individual, who holds verifiable credentials in a digital wallet and selectively shares them as needed.

The stakes of identity architecture are difficult to overstate. In the current system, identity is fragmented across hundreds of platforms, each of which extracts data for profit, can revoke access arbitrarily, and creates honeypots for data breaches. Government identity systems, while more stable, require trust in state institutions and create centralized points of surveillance and control. As AI surveillance capabilities accelerate, the question of who controls identity infrastructure becomes a question about the future of human freedom itself.

Self-sovereign identity connects to [[zero-knowledge-proofs]] as the cryptographic foundation that enables selective disclosure -- proving attributes without revealing underlying data. It relates to [[ethereum-localism]] through decentralized protocols that can host identity infrastructure without centralized gatekeepers, and to [[technological-sovereignty]] as a key component of communities' capacity to govern their own digital environment. SSI is not merely a technical convenience; it is a precondition for genuine [[participatory-democracy]] in the digital age, ensuring that civic participation cannot be gatekept by platform corporations or surveilled by intelligence agencies.
