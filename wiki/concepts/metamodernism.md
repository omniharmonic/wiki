# Metamodernism

Metamodernism is a cultural and philosophical sensibility that moves beyond the impasse between modernist sincerity and postmodern irony. Where modernism believed in grand narratives of progress and universal truth, and postmodernism deconstructed those narratives as power plays, metamodernism oscillates between the two -- holding sincere commitment and ironic awareness simultaneously. It is the capacity to believe in something while knowing your belief is constructed, to work earnestly toward a vision while remaining humble about its limitations.

This oscillation is not fence-sitting or contradiction; it is a developmental capacity. The meta-crisis requires people who can hold complexity without collapsing into either naive idealism or cynical paralysis. Metamodernism provides the philosophical ground for this: you can work passionately for bioregional governance while acknowledging the contingency of your framework. You can critique capitalism rigorously while building practical alternatives within it. The "both/and" is not a compromise but a more adequate response to reality's complexity.

Metamodernism connects to [[integral-theory]] through its attention to developmental stages and the integration of multiple perspectives. It relates to [[dialectics]] as a dialectical movement beyond the thesis of modernism and the antithesis of postmodernism. It provides the cultural ground for [[emergent-strategy]] -- organizing that embraces complexity and adaptation rather than rigid ideology. And it names the sensibility needed to navigate the [[meta-crisis]] without retreating into either fundamentalist certainty or nihilistic despair.
