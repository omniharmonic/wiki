# Collective Intelligence

Collective intelligence is the shared capacity for knowing and decision-making that emerges when individuals collaborate, coordinate, and share information through effective structures. It is not simply the sum of individual intelligences but an emergent property of the relationships, feedback loops, and communication patterns between participants.

Nature provides the foundational models: mycelial networks share nutrients and chemical signals across entire forest ecosystems; ant colonies solve complex logistics problems through simple local rules; immune systems learn and adapt without central coordination. These [[living-systems]] demonstrate that intelligence can be distributed rather than centralized, and that the quality of the connections matters as much as the quality of the nodes.

For civic innovation, collective intelligence challenges the assumption that good governance requires a small number of brilliant leaders. Instead, it suggests that well-designed participatory structures -- [[citizen-assemblies]], federated knowledge commons, open-source collaboration -- can outperform top-down expertise by integrating diverse perspectives and local knowledge. The [[cosmolocalism]] principle of "light global, heavy local" is itself a collective intelligence architecture: knowledge circulates freely while decisions stay grounded in place. Technologies like [[quadratic-voting]] and [[liquid-democracy]] are mechanism designs that attempt to channel collective intelligence into concrete governance outcomes.
