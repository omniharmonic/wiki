# Consent-Based Governance

Consent-based governance is a decision-making framework in which proposals move forward not when everyone agrees they are optimal, but when no participant raises a paramount objection -- a reasoned concern that the proposal would cause significant harm or fundamentally undermine the group's shared purpose. Rooted in sociocratic practice and articulated by practitioners like Sheri Herndon, consent represents a profound shift from consensus: rather than asking "do you think this is the best possible decision?", it asks "can you live with this decision? Do you see any reason this would cause real harm?"

This reframe resolves a persistent tension in non-hierarchical organizing. Consensus-based processes frequently produce either paralysis, where groups cannot reach full agreement, or coercion, where participants publicly agree while harboring private reservations to avoid blocking the group. Consent creates space for both stronger dissent and clearer forward movement. Strong dissent becomes explicit and legible: "I see a paramount objection that requires attention." Everything else -- reservations, alternative preferences, uncertainties -- can be held openly while the group moves forward together. As Benjamin Life writes, consent acknowledges that in complex systems we often cannot know in advance what the best decision is; we can only commit to what seems workable given current understanding and learn together as we implement.

Consent-based governance connects to [[participatory-democracy]] as a practical methodology for distributed decision-making that honors multiple forms of authority. It complements [[citizen-assemblies]] by providing a ratification process for deliberative outcomes. It supports [[collective-intelligence]] by maintaining generative diversity rather than forcing artificial unity, and it embodies the ecological organizing principles of [[commons-governance]] where power flows dynamically according to context and need rather than positional hierarchy.
