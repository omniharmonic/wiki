# Regenerative Finance

Regenerative finance (ReFi) refers to financial instruments, systems, and practices designed to fund regenerative outcomes -- directing capital toward the restoration of ecosystems, the strengthening of communities, and the creation of shared prosperity rather than private extraction. It represents an attempt to redesign finance itself so that the flow of capital actively heals rather than harms.

Traditional finance operates on a logic of extraction: capital flows toward the highest risk-adjusted return, regardless of social or ecological consequences. Impact investing attempted a correction by adding social metrics, but often remained anchored in extractive return expectations. Regenerative finance goes further, redesigning the fundamental architecture of financial instruments to align capital flows with living systems. This includes patient capital structures with capped returns, community-owned investment vehicles, ecological credit systems, and blockchain-based mechanisms for transparently tracking regenerative outcomes.

ReFi connects to [[ethereum-localism]] through the use of decentralized protocols for community-governed finance, to [[quadratic-funding]] as a mechanism for democratically allocating resources to public goods, and to [[compost-capital]] as a strategy for transforming existing extractive wealth into regenerative community assets. Within the broader framework of [[regenerative-economics]], regenerative finance provides the circulatory system -- the means by which resources flow to where they can do the most restorative work. [[bioregional-finance]] represents its place-based expression, organizing financial systems around ecological rather than political boundaries.
